## Overview

**The Case of the Curious QC** is an interactive, browser-based case study that guides users through a **quality control investigation** in a clinical chemistry lab. Through a sequence of decision-based questions, users explore potential causes of unusual lab results and apply their reasoning to solve the mystery of a suspicious lipid profile.

Designed to support teaching and learning in laboratory medicine, this tool encourages learners to think critically about **internal quality control (IQC)**, result validation, and the broader implications of analytical error.

## Learning Objectives

- Recognize indicators of quality control anomalies  
- Differentiate between analytical and biological sources of error  
- Apply systematic reasoning to clinical data  
- Consider appropriate follow-up actions in the lab  
- Reinforce understanding of lipid metabolism and interpretation

---

## Features

- Case-based learning with interactive decision-making  
- iochemistry scenario focused on lipid profiles  
- Clinical and technical reasoning steps   
- Fully browser-based â€“ no installation required

---

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.  
2. Read the clinical scenario and accompanying lab results.  
3. Work through the interpretation questions in order.  
4. Review the final summary of your case-based decisions.
