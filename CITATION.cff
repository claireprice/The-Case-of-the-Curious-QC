abstract: >
  The Case of the Curious QC is a browser-based educational tool designed to simulate a quality control 
  investigation in a clinical biochemistry lab. Through interactive questioning and guided reasoning, users 
  explore the potential causes of suspicious lipid results and decide how to respond. Designed for students 
  and educators in laboratory medicine, this tool promotes practical understanding of internal QC principles 
  and analytical problem-solving. For educational use only.
